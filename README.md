# Animator Utilities
This is a collection of Pure Data patches to convert between timecode/frames, calculate shot duration, and roughly estimate job time on a render farm.

I created these tools to simplify my workflow when creating 3D animation scenes in Maya and After Effects. So these tools use a frame rate of 30fps for their conversions. But the patches can be edited to work at other frame rates, should you need.

### Requires use of Pd-Extended
It's free and open source. Available for Mac, Windows, & Linux.<br>

### Calculate shot duration: input as timecode or frames
Especially useful when adjusting timings between two versions of the animatic and need to figure out the exact amount of time added or removed.

### Estimate Job Render Time on a Farm
Most useful for estimating the min/max time until the render is complete. Which is especially important if youâ€™re worried about bottlenecking your farm and need to prioritize for deadlines.
